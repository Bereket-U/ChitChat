### How the Game Works

Start by creating an account and logging in. Once you are logged in you can edit your profile by adding a bio and a profile picture. Go ahead and make a new post to see it on the timeline or on your profile!

## Future Additions

In the future I think it would be cool to add:

- a "like" feature on each post
- the ability to follow other users and filter the timeline by users you follow
- profile picture display on the users posts
- the ability to repost other users posts to your own profile
- see what words are trending in other users posts
